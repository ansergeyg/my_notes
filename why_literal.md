I was always wondering why in programming the term 'literal' is used for assigned values.

For example:

1) String literal

2) Object literal

Why not just the value?

Turns out (thanks to gpt):

The term "literal" emphasizes the direct representation of the value. It’s **not** a value **derived from** another value or calculation. 

For example:"Hello" is a literal, not because it’s **assigned to a variable**, but because it **literally** represents the string value.

In contrast, x = 10 would not be called a literal because the value 10 is assigned to x; it’s a value being assigned rather than an explicit value in your code.
