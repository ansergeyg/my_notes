1) When you create a new aspnet project it's better to create it in the following template:

GeneralRepository  (matching yoru git repository name)
 - Project 1
 - Project 2
 ..
 - Project for tests

Commands:

1) We start from creating a solution file: 

dotnet new sln . 

The . is matching your cloned git repository. Or if you intend to create a subdirectory use dotnet new sln -o _name_

Let's check what's inside of .sln file:

more .\sln_name.sln


2) Now let's create some projects:

dotnet new classlib -o Project_1

dotnet new xunit -o Project_for_tests

If we try to build what we have now:

dotnet build

we will get some warnings.

It's because our projects and our solution exists separately. Let's joing them:

3) dotnet sln add (ls -r **/*.csproj)

ChatGPT:

    **: The double asterisk ** is a recursive glob pattern. It matches zero or more directories and subdirectories. 
        In other words, it allows you to search through all levels of subdirectories.
    /*: The forward slash / followed by an asterisk * is used to match all files and directories within the current directory.

When you combine ** with /* as **/*, you get a pattern that matches all files and directories recursively from the current directory and its subdirectories. 
It's a convenient way to perform operations on all files or a specific type of file (in your case, .csproj files) within a directory tree.

Now we can build:

dotnet build

4) Now it's time to add references.

dotnet add reference Project_1 Project_2 ...

Or if you want to specify the project to which you want to add a reference:

dotnet add to_project reference from_project

DON'T FORGET TO REBUILD AND IF REFERENCES DON'T WORK CLOSE AN REPOEND VSCODE

Now how to run tests?

If you have C# Dev Kit installed then vscode will be automaically find and detect your tests. 

You will actually see a green arrow right next to your test method.

If you don't see it it means that you need to either rebuild or close/open vscode or check if your plugin works properly.

There is also a beaker button in the vertical tool panel you can use it to open tests explorer window.
